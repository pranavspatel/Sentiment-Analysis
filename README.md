# Goal of the Project
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of product reviews as either positive or negative.
# Specifications
1. Download the "Product Sentiment" dataset from a provided link.

2. Load, clean, and preprocess the data as necessary. This may involve removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and converting text data into a numerical representation that can be used as input to a machine learning model.

3. Train a classification model using your favourite machine learning algorithm. Consider using techniques such as hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to improve the performance of the model.

4. Use the testing data to measure the accuracy and F1-score of the model.

5. Given the accuracy and F1-score, determine whether the model's performance is satisfactory from a business point of view. Explain your reasoning.

2. You may need to handle imbalanced data, where the number of positive and negative reviews is not equal. This can be done through techniques such as oversampling or undersampling.

3. You may want to consider additional evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy and F1-score, such as precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
Be sure to document your process and the decisions you made throughout the project. This may include the preprocessing steps you took, the hyperparameter values you tried, and any other considerations that influenced your model design.
