# Sentiment-analysis Natural Language Processing
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the sentiment of product reviews as either positive or negative.

## Findings
1. We can see that the precision is 80 % and the accuracy is around 76 % which is not desirable for the production. AUC score is around 86.2% which great for the model performance.
2. Need better cross validation approach eg using Random SearchCV.

# Ways to improve model accuracy 
1. Can use Voting Classifier for multiple models 
2. Apply Stacking for combination of algorithms.
3. Incorporate additinal features in the model.
